# Introduction

Welcome to DHRIFT!

During this workshop, you will learn about the DHRIFT platform, including its directory of available workshops, interactive features, and pedagogical philosophy. You will learn to build your own DHRIFT website for a mock institute, including modifying and customizing existing DHRIFT content. By creating DHRIFT sites, you will also learn about DHRIFT’s underlying technologies: how workshop markdown files are created, ingested, and displayed, how they are stored and processed through GitHub actions, and how institute leaders can use the platform's wizard to build an institute based on your community’s needs.

# What is DHRIFT?

To start, DHRIFT is the platform you are currently using to access this workshop! 

To be more specific, DHRIFT (Digital Humanities Resource Infrastructure for Teaching Technology) is an open educational resource (OER) and publication platform for DH workshops. Designed by humanities scholars for humanities scholars, DHRIFT provides a minimal computing, accessibility-aware, and interactive environment for teaching fundamental DH concepts. 

The platform includes a core set of more than 10 reviewed and tested workshops that have been developed and tested during two NEH-funded, week-long institutes, called the Digital Humanities Research Institutes (DHRI). Workshop topics range from learning the basics of Python, JavaScript, and R to conducting research through text analysis, data wrangling, and mapping. You can see the full list of workshops on the workshops page, accessible from the header menu or [by clicking here](https://app.dhrift.org/workshops/?instUser=dhri-curriculum&instRepo=dhrift-site-template&user=dhri-curriculum&repo=workshops). 

DHRIFT’s core workshops are accessible from and usable on our website; however, its flexible framework also allows users to build their own customized, static DHRIFT sites tailoring them to for a variety of situations, such as teaching an undergraduate or graduate class, hosting a week-long skills institute, or organizing a series of professional development workshops. DHRIFT facilitates an instructor or organizations’ ability to reproduce, adapt, and publish DH workshops with interactive, learner-focused features.
