"In my computational linguistics research, I'd like to engage with extensive textual datasets like the Common Crawl, a web archive offering a diverse collection of web pages in multiple languages. This data source enables people to study linguistic patterns and trends in real-world contexts. Also the Persona-Chat dataset is another valuable resource that aids in training chatbots to generate contextually appropriate responses.
By participating in this Python course, I aim to bolster my programming skills, enabling me to efficiently process and analyze linguistic datasets, which I still cannot do in my program.",Archive,Census,,

"As a first year student, I am in the process of getting an IRB approval for future data collection which will include a series of narratives written by the Russian Fulbright students. Moreover, I am planning to use digitized texts (social media like vk.com, twitter, instagram), songs, books, and other cultural tools to analyze the themes covered in them before and after the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, news reports from the governmental and independent media.",Text,Images,Museum Collections,
"I am deeply interested in exploring the rich potential of open city datasets in future research projects. These datasets, encompassing a wide range of urban-related information such as demographics, infrastructure, public health, and socio-economic indicators, offer a treasure trove of data for urban studies. A notable example is the New York City Open Data portal (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/), which hosts an extensive collection of data sets invaluable for comprehensive urban analysis.

My specific interest lies in utilizing these datasets to investigate urban challenges and development. I am particularly keen to analyze public health and environmental data to explore the relationship between urban planning and public health outcomes. This includes studying the impact of factors like air quality and green spaces on the health and well-being of city residents. Additionally, I plan to delve into demographic and public transportation data to assess the accessibility and efficiency of public services in large metropolitan areas.

This research aligns with my academic background in data analysis and social sciences, allowing me to contribute meaningful insights into sustainable urban development and public policy. By leveraging open city datasets, I aim to develop a nuanced understanding of urban ecosystems and contribute to data-driven solutions addressing contemporary urban challenges.",Archive,Images,,
"Sometimes I work with experimental results that need to be plotted or analyzed, but since I am a theorist, I am often starting with fundamental physics equations and applying them to a specific system. I work in photonics, so I am often using equations for electromagnetism and quantum mechanics as my starting point. Most recently, I used Matlab to model the geometry and coupling between atoms of a specific type of crystal lattice. Once I had this framework, I was able to use basic physics equations to learn more about how light would interact with this particular structure.",Text,Images,,
"Of the parenthetically described items, I have worked with books, digitized texts, images, archival records, and open city datasets. I have not worked with any of them in a computational/programming capacity, though -- for the most part, I've interacted with them for pleasure, or through searches connected to my work as a legal services attorney. I have not worked with any of the remaining materials in a serious capacity, but I imagine it would be useful to do so. It is a bit difficult to conceive of how I'd do so, given the limits on my current knowledge. So, I'd be interested in working with any of them.",Text,Museum Collections,,

"Besides the Black and Queer literature that I work with for my dissertation (Lorde’s Zami, Paule Marshall’s Triangular Road, Shani Mootoo’s Cereus Blooms at Night, Rwandan novelist Scholastique Mukasonga’s work, and Nigerian playwright Tess Onwueme’s work), the largest research materials I have worked with in the past is the Tess Onwueme Papers at University of Wisconsin Madison, Eau Claire. These archival materials inform a lot of my research around the relationship between love and social justice (my dissertation topic), and I think they need to be made public in some way. I’m also interested in generally digitizing my thinking and research as Queer and Race-based activism, in a similar way to Monica Roberts, also known as the Trans Griot, whose blog was a centerpiece of Black trans activism in the 2000s. Finally, I’m interested in working with the NYPL Schomburg Center for a digitization fellowship that I will be applying for. Having better digital literacy would greatly help me in this project, and it would allow me to better engage with this Black archive, which would be incredibly useful for my dissertation work that features some New York Black leaders such as James Baldwin and Audre Lorde.",Archive,Open City Data,Books,Images

"I'm currently facing the challenge of organizing and analyzing vast amounts of scattered and disorganized archival data. This experience has fueled my interest in developing effective strategies for data management and analysis, particularly in the context of large-scale datasets. 

My previous research projects have involved organizing and analyzing census data from various sources to examine trends in population growth, migration patterns, and socioeconomic disparities. This work has highlighted the importance of data management methodologies that can effectively handle the complexities of large-scale demographic datasets.

My ongoing research interests lie in exploring novel data management and analysis techniques that can effectively address the challenges of organizing and analyzing large-scale demographic datasets.",Images,,,
"Working in the Children's Education departments at the American Museum of Natural History and the New York Botanical Gardens allowed me to witness behind the scenes of how informal surroundings may encourage new generations to participate in STEM. Working with scientists and educators in various fields, I realized that scientific and cultural museums, such as the world's largest museum and education institution, The Smithsonian Institution, have museum collections such as their book collections (https://library.si.edu/digital-library/collection/cultivating-americas-gardens). I would be interested in working with a potential research project of digital storytelling in classrooms inspired by books and items from the Smithsonian collection that can allow students to connect through the lens of identity, ancestral foodways, and the power of familial stories combined with artistic mediums. Being a GC Digital Fellow, I would learn new onset skills of learning programming language such as Python or R track and how to look at research materials such as museum databases or collection other than my knowledge of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS).

"Recently I completed a project where I analyzed H-1B visa datasets from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services H-1B Employer Data Hub (https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub/h-1b-employer-data-hub-files). I cleaned the data sets and then investigated how H-1B visa approvals have changed over time, where were the top industries for visa approvals, and where were the top employers by states, city, and company using basic Excel, SQL, and Tableau skills (link to presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuJ9JAg25ls&list=LL&index=37). I am still working on improving this project by continually growing my technical skills. 
For my capstone project, I want my project to be based on quantitative analysis and immigration. I anticipate needing to use census data, open city data, and data from non-profits/NGO’s. A possible topic I want to pursue is to investigate where recent migrants that were transported to New York City have settled in, and what the reception local communities has been. I’d also like to investigate Mayor Adam’s claim on the economic cost of migrants to the city by looking at past city data over time when similar waves of immigrants have come.",Museum Collections,,,
